## Requirements:
1. Python 2.6 or 2.7
2. A working version of mpi installed 
3. mpi4py [Download and install guide](http://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)

***

##Usage: 

###greedy_search_mpi.py

./greedy_search_mpi.py is used to search for required precision (without randomizing inputs & statistics guided refining process).

You can modify the variable `error_rate` at the beginning of the code to change the expected output quality. 

`chmod +x ./greedy_search_mpi.py`

run `mpirun -np 1 ./greedy_search_mpi.py` to see usage

mpirun -np [number_of_threads] ./search.py [seed_number] [program_name]

example: run the script with 4 threads, 1 master and 3 workers, searching on the program name test_mpfr.

`mpirun -np 4 ./search.py 123 test_mpfr`

Seed_number is unused for regular programs.
It will be used and this script will be automatically called when we are running statistics guided refining process (statistics_guided_search.py). (seed_number) will be passed to the program to generate random inputs.

###statistics_guided_search.py

You can modify TARGET_SQNR to change the expected SQNR. Other variable at the beginning of the code can also changed, please refer to the comments in the code for more information

`chmod +x ./statistics_guided_search.py`

`./statistics_guided_search.py original_version mpfr_version`

example: run the precision tuning tool with statistics guided refinement process, float or double version = test_program. mpfr version = test_mpfr:

`./statistics_guided_search.py test_program test_mpfr`

***

To try the searching script with sample mpfr programs & setup script, please go to the folder `examples\` in this directory for further instruction
